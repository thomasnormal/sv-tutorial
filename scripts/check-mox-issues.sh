# Polls normal-computing/mox issues blocking tutorial lessons for state changes.
# Usage: ./scripts/check-mox-issues.sh [--loop]
#   --loop  : run every 5 minutes until interrupted (default: check once)
#
# Tracked issues (open):
#   #14  virtual if in separate file → compiler crash  (UVM driver/env/monitor/coverage lessons)
#   #20  interface signal writes in tasks don't drive DUT  (sv/tasks-functions)
#   #24  wait fork returns on first completion (join_any semantics instead of join)
#   #25  static unpacked arrays of 4-state types in class bodies lose written values (read X)
#   #26  std::randomize() always returns same constant value, ignores constraints
#   #27  queue equality comparison between two queue variables fails legalization
#   #28  static local variables in functions not preserved across calls (treated as automatic)
#   #29  clocking block inside interface cannot reference interface port (unknown name)
#   #30  queue variable with pattern initializer at module level is empty (size 0)
#   #31  constraint solver drops individual bounds when cross-variable expression present
#   #32  single-bit signal writes via modport in parameterized interface don't propagate
#   #33  $sscanf always returns 0 and does not parse any values
#   #34  unpacked arrays of struct types: member writes fail (reads as 0/X)
#   #35  array method 'with' clause ignored in sum/product/max/min
#   #36  assign inside generate-for loop doesn't drive unpacked array elements (reads X)
#   #37  $cast to enum succeeds (returns 1) for values not defined in the enum
#   #38  inside constraint with value list (not range) ignored by constraint solver
#   #39  $dimensions returns N+1 for unpacked arrays of integer scalar types (int, etc.)
#   #40  writes to 2D (multidimensional) unpacked arrays silently fail (reads as 0)
#   #41  constraint implication operator (->) silently ignored
#   #42  rand_mode(0) on class object doesn't freeze all rand variables
#   #43  $sformatf/display %h shows too few digits for int type
#   #44  $rose/$fell/$stable in always_ff fails with moore.past legalization error
#   #45  dist constraint generates values outside the distribution
#   #46  array locator methods find/find_first/find_last with 'with' clause always return empty
#   #47  wait(condition) resumes at wrong simulation time (~10ns polling delay)
#   #48  $finish/$fatal inside fork...join body fails codegen: 'llhd.halt' expects 'llhd.process'
#   #49  $rtoi() constant-folds negative fractional values to 0 instead of truncating toward zero
#   #50  ref argument writes not visible outside task: stale pre-call value used in comparisons
#   #51  packed union member writes silently fail: drive through unrealized_conversion_cast has no effect
#   #52  array/queue slice (a[lo:hi]) fails: dynamic arrays give legalization error, queues return empty
#   #53  queue literal q={e1,e2,...} creates correct-size queue but all element values are 0
#   #59  queue copy (q2=q1) only copies first element correctly — remaining elements read as 0
#   #61  $countbits(v,1'b1) and $countbits(v,1'b0) always return 0
#   #64  $countbits(v,1'bx) and $countbits(v,1'bz) rejected at compile time
#   #65  streaming operators ({>> N {unpacked_array}}) fail: "cannot be cast to simple bit vector"
#
# Closed (fixed upstream):
#   #21  UVM run_phase phase-cleanup deadlock  → fixed in 401f5dc8c
#   #22  class-level constraints ignored on plain randomize()  → fixed in 401f5dc8c
#   #23  UVM factory type_id::set_type_override() no effect  → fixed in 401f5dc8c
