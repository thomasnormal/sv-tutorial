              <p>For the SRAM we care about exercising both halves of the address space — not just "did any address get hit." <strong>Named bins</strong> let you group values into meaningful categories:</p>
              <pre>coverpoint addr {
  bins lo_half = {[0:7]};    // group: lower 8 addresses
  bins hi_half = {[8:15]};   // group: upper 8 addresses
}</pre>
              <p>Now coverage is measured per group, not per raw value. You can also exclude values you never intend to exercise with <dfn data-card="ignore_bins marks certain values as uninteresting and excludes them from the coverage calculation. They won't count as covered or uncovered — the tool simply ignores them. Use this for reserved encodings, invalid states, or values that are impossible in your test environment. Contrast with illegal_bins, which additionally causes a simulation error if the value is ever seen.">ignore_bins</dfn>:</p>
              <pre>ignore_bins reserved = {14, 15};  // these addresses are off-limits</pre>
              <p>Open <code>cov_bins.sv</code>. The <code>cp_we</code> coverpoint already has explicit bins. Add explicit bins to <code>cp_addr</code>:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>A bin for the lower half of the address space (0–7)</li>
                <li>A bin for the upper half (8–15), but exclude addresses 14 and 15 as reserved using <code>ignore_bins</code></li>
              </ul>
              <blockquote><p>There is also <code>illegal_bins</code> — like <code>ignore_bins</code> it is excluded from coverage, but it additionally causes a simulation error if the value ever occurs. Use it for encodings that should be impossible, not just uninteresting.</p></blockquote>
