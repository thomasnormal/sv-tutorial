<p>Welcome to the interactive SystemVerilog tutorial — a hands-on guide to the hardware description and verification language used throughout the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1 — SystemVerilog Basics</strong> covers the building blocks of synthesisable RTL: modules and ports, combinational logic with <code>always_comb</code>, sequential logic with <code>always_ff</code>, parameterized modules, state machines, and coverage fundamentals.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2 — SystemVerilog Assertions</strong> covers formal and simulation-based verification: immediate and concurrent assertions, clock-delay sequences, implication operators, sampled-value functions, and advanced property techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3 — Universal Verification Methodology</strong> covers the industry-standard verification framework: UVM components, testbench architecture, sequences, drivers, monitors, scoreboards, and environments.</p>
<blockquote><p>Prior experience with digital logic (flip-flops, gates, clocks) is assumed. Experience with another HDL is helpful but not required.</p></blockquote>
<p>Every SystemVerilog program is wrapped in a <code>module</code>. An <code>initial</code> block runs once at time zero. Add a <code>$display</code> call to print a message, then press <strong>⌘ Enter</strong> to run it.</p>
