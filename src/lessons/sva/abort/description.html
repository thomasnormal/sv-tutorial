<p>Sometimes an in-progress property should be terminated early — either because an abort condition renders the check irrelevant, or because its occurrence should itself be flagged as a failure. SVA provides two operators for this:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code><dfn data-card="reject_on(cond) prop immediately fails the property if cond becomes true while prop is being evaluated, regardless of how far through the sequence it has progressed. It's used to express 'no error should occur during this operation.' The synchronous variant sync_reject_on only checks cond at the property's clock edge. accept_on is the dual — it immediately passes (without failure) if cond fires.">reject_on</dfn>(cond) prop</code> — if <code>cond</code> becomes true while <code>prop</code> is being evaluated, <strong>fail</strong> immediately.</li>
  <li><code>accept_on(cond) prop</code> — if <code>cond</code> becomes true, <strong>pass</strong> immediately (abort without failure).</li>
</ul>
<p>Both have synchronous variants — <code>sync_reject_on</code> and <code>sync_accept_on</code> — that only sample <code>cond</code> at the property's clock edge instead of asynchronously.</p>
<p>Open <code>abort_check.sv</code> and complete the property body: after <code>start</code>, <code>ack</code> must arrive within 4 cycles — but if <code>err</code> fires mid-burst, fail immediately using <code>reject_on</code>.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>reject_on(cond) seq</code> is equivalent to <code>(!cond) throughout seq</code> — both fail when <code>cond</code> goes true during the sequence window. <code>reject_on</code> is more expressive because it also applies to composite properties, not just sequences.</p></blockquote>
