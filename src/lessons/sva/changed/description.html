<p><code><dfn data-card="$changed(sig) is a sampled value function that returns true when sig's sampled value at the current clock edge differs from its value at the previous clock edge. It's a shorthand for sig !== $past(sig). Uses four-state inequality so it also fires on transitions to/from X. Use it to write 'while update is high, data must change every cycle' without repeating $past explicitly.">$changed</dfn>(sig)</code> returns true when a signal's sampled value differs from its value at the previous clock edge — a concise way to write <code>sig !== $past(sig)</code>.</p>
<p>The companion function <code>$sampled(expr)</code> returns the value of an expression as sampled in the preponed region (the settled value at the clock edge). It is most useful inside action blocks to print what the checker actually saw:</p>
<pre>else $error("data unchanged: 0x%0h", $sampled(data));</pre>
<p>Open <code>toggle_check.sv</code> and complete the property body: while <code>update</code> is high, <code>data</code> must change every cycle.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>$changed</code> uses four-state inequality (<code>!==</code>) so it is also true when a signal transitions to or from X. To ignore X transitions use <code>data != $past(data)</code> (two-state inequality) instead.</p></blockquote>
