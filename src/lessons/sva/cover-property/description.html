              <p>If an assertion never fires, it could mean the design is correct — or that the triggering condition was <em>never exercised</em>. These are very different situations.</p>
              <p><code><dfn data-card="cover property records each time a property's sequence fully matches — counting successes rather than failures. While assert property checks 'this must always hold', cover property checks 'did this scenario ever happen?'. It is essential for catching vacuous test suites: if your assert never fires because its antecedent never triggers, cover property exposes this silence. Always pair assert and cover on the same property — zero cover hits with zero assert failures usually means the test is not exercising the right conditions.">cover property</dfn></code> resolves this ambiguity. Its pass action runs each time the property <em>succeeds</em>, confirming the antecedent was actually stimulated:</p>
              <p>Open <code>bus_check.sv</code>. It models a simple bus protocol: when <code>frame_</code> rises (transaction boundary), the <code>ldp_</code> strobe must fall (assert) within 1–2 cycles. The property <code>ldpcheck</code> is already written. Add both the <code>assert property</code> and <code>cover property</code> statements for it.</p>
              <blockquote><p>Always pair <code>assert</code> and <code>cover</code> on the same property. A simulation that sees no assertion failures but also no cover hits has told you almost nothing.</p></blockquote>
