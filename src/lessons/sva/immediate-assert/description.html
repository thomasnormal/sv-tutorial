              <p>In the previous chapter you ran concurrent assertions driven by a testbench — the simulator only checked the paths you drove. A <strong><dfn data-card="A model checker (or formal verification tool) mathematically proves that a design satisfies a property for ALL possible inputs and ALL possible time sequences — not just the ones you thought to test. It works by exploring a symbolic representation of the state space. If a property can be violated, it produces a concrete counterexample trace. If no counterexample exists up to a given depth, the property is proved for that bound.">model checker</dfn></strong> goes further: it exhaustively explores every possible input sequence up to a bounded depth, finding counterexamples without any testbench at all. The lessons from here on use CIRCT's <dfn data-card="BMC (Bounded Model Checking) unrolls the circuit's behavior for N time steps and encodes it as a SAT/SMT formula. The solver then searches for an assignment of inputs that makes an assertion fail. If no such assignment exists within N steps, the property is proved for depth N. BMC is complete for safety properties up to the bound — deeper bugs require larger bounds or inductive techniques.">bounded model checker</dfn> (BMC).</p>
              <p>Before concurrent assertions, there are <strong>immediate assertions</strong> — non-temporal checks that live inside a procedural block. They fire the instant the simulator reaches them, like a runtime sanity check:</p>
              <pre>assert (expression)
  pass_action;
else
  fail_action;</pre>
              <p>If the expression is <code>0</code>, <code>x</code>, or <code>z</code>, the assertion <strong>fails</strong> and the <code>else</code> branch runs.</p>
              <p>Open <code>fifo_checker.sv</code> and add two assertions inside the <code>always @(posedge clk)</code> block — one that prevents writing to a full FIFO, and one that prevents reading from an empty FIFO. Express each condition as a Boolean that must always be true.</p>
              <blockquote><p>Use <code>$error</code> in the else clause for an automatic timestamp and file/line location in the log.</p></blockquote>
