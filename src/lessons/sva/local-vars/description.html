              <p>A <strong><dfn data-card="A local variable in an SVA sequence is a temporary variable that captures a signal value at a specific clock cycle and carries it into later cycles of the same sequence evaluation. This lets you write data-flow properties like 'whatever value was on in_data when valid_in was high must appear on out_data 3 cycles later.' Local variables are thread-local — each concurrent evaluation of the sequence gets its own independent copy.">local variable</dfn></strong> in a sequence captures a signal's value at one clock edge and carries it forward to a later comparison — something you cannot do with plain signal references:</p>
              <p>The comma operator <code>(cond, v = expr)</code> simultaneously checks the trigger condition and captures a value into the local variable. On a later cycle, compare the captured value to another signal:</p>
              <pre>(trigger, v = signal) |=> ##N (other == v)</pre>
              <p>Open <code>pipeline_check.sv</code>. Capture <code>in_data</code> when <code>valid_in</code> is high, then verify that <code>out_data</code> equals it exactly 3 cycles later.</p>
              <blockquote><p>Local variables are thread-local: every concurrent evaluation of the sequence gets its own copy, so overlapping in-flight transactions are checked independently.</p></blockquote>
