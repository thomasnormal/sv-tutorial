<p>The <strong>non-consecutive equal repetition</strong> operator <code>[=m]</code> requires a boolean to be true exactly <em>m</em> times — with the same flexibility as <code>[->m]</code> regarding gaps, but with one key difference at the end:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>sig[->m]</code> — sequence ends <em>at</em> the m-th true cycle</li>
  <li><code>sig[=m]</code> — sequence ends at <em>any later cycle</em> after the m-th true cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>This matters when the signal that follows (<code>done</code>, <code>ready</code>, …) can arrive on the same cycle as the last match or several cycles after it:</p>
<pre>// [->3]: done must be the cycle immediately after the 3rd ack
req |=> ack[->3] ##1 done

// [=3]: done may arrive at any point on or after the 3rd ack
req |=> ack[=3] ##[0:$] done</pre>
<p>Open <code>multi_ack2.sv</code> and complete the property body using <code>ack[=3] ##[0:$] done</code>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Use <code>[=m]</code> when the protocol says "exactly m pulses must occur before completion" but the completion signal has variable latency. Use <code>[->m]</code> when completion is defined as arriving one cycle after the final pulse.</p></blockquote>
