<p>A <strong>concurrent assertion</strong> runs in parallel with the design and samples signals at a clock edge. It consists of three pieces:</p>
<ol>
  <li>A <strong>sequence</strong> — a temporal pattern using the <code>##</code> clock-delay operator</li>
  <li>A <strong>property</strong> — attaches the sequence to a clock and a trigger condition</li>
  <li>An <strong>assert</strong> — evaluates the property at every clock edge</li>
</ol>
<p>Open <code>grant_check.sv</code>. The spec is: <em>when <code>cStart</code> is high, <code>req</code> must be high the same cycle and <code>gnt</code> must be high exactly 2 cycles later.</em></p>
<p>Fill in the sequence body, the property body, and add the <code>assert property</code> statement.</p>
<blockquote><p>A property is never evaluated on its own — it must be <strong>asserted</strong>, <strong>covered</strong>, or <strong>assumed</strong>.</p></blockquote>
