<p>The <strong><code><dfn data-card="throughout in SVA requires an expression to remain true at every clock tick for the entire duration of a sequence. 'expr throughout seq' fails the moment expr becomes false while seq is still running. It's the standard idiom for 'chip-select must stay asserted for the entire transfer' or 'enable must hold high while the operation completes.' Equivalent to sync_reject_on(!expr) seq.">throughout</dfn></code></strong> operator requires an expression to hold true at <em>every</em> clock tick for the entire duration of a sequence:</p>
<pre>expr throughout seq</pre>
<p>At each evaluation step of <code>seq</code>, <code>expr</code> is checked. If <code>expr</code> ever goes false while <code>seq</code> is still running, the sequence fails.</p>
<p>A typical use is mode/enable stability: chip-select must stay asserted for an entire 8-clock SPI transfer. Once <code>cs_n</code> falls (goes active-low), it must not rise again for the whole transfer — 8 consecutive MOSI bits.</p>
<p>Open <code>spi_check.sv</code> and complete the property: when <code>cs_n</code> falls, use <code>throughout</code> to assert that <code>cs_n</code> stays low for an 8-cycle MOSI sequence.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>(!cs_n) throughout seq</code> is equivalent to writing <code>sync_reject_on(cs_n) seq</code> — both fail as soon as <code>cs_n</code> rises mid-transfer. <code>throughout</code> is usually more readable for the stability idiom.</p></blockquote>
