<p>Every named sequence has a built-in property <code>.triggered</code> that is true at the clock tick where the sequence reaches its endpoint:</p>
<pre>sequence s_req_done;
  @(posedge clk) req ##1 !busy;
endsequence

// .triggered is a boolean: true at the cycle s_req_done ends
s_req_done.triggered |-> ##[1:3] ack</pre>
<p>This lets you build modular properties: define a sequence once, then reference its endpoint from multiple properties without duplicating the sequence body.</p>
<p>The related <code>.matched</code> property extends the endpoint signal so it stays true until the <em>next</em> clock edge of a different clock domain — useful for cross-clock handshake assertions.</p>
<p>Open <code>trigger_check.sv</code> and complete the property: when the request sequence ends, <code>ack</code> must arrive within 3 cycles.</p>
<blockquote><p><code>.triggered</code> can only be used in the antecedent of an implication or as a standalone assertion — it is not a sequence itself. If you need to use a sequence endpoint <em>inside</em> another sequence, embed the sequence directly with <code>seq1 ##0 seq2</code> (zero-delay concatenation).</p></blockquote>
