<p>The <strong><code>until</code></strong> family of operators expresses "hold this condition while waiting for that one":</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>p <dfn data-card="until in SVA is a temporal operator: 'p until q' means p must hold true at every clock tick starting now, until q becomes true. The weak form doesn't require q to ever occur — if the trace ends without q firing, the property still passes. The strong form s_until requires q to eventually happen. until_with adds the requirement that p also holds on the same cycle q fires.">until</dfn> q</code> — weak: <code>p</code> holds at every tick until <code>q</code> becomes true. If <code>q</code> never occurs the property still holds (vacuously).</li>
  <li><code>p s_until q</code> — strong: same as above but <code>q</code> <em>must</em> eventually occur.</li>
  <li><code>p until_with q</code> — inclusive: <code>p</code> is also required to hold on the same cycle that <code>q</code> first becomes true.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open <code>hold_check.sv</code> and complete two properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>p_valid_holds</strong>: once <code>valid</code> goes high it must stay high until <code>done</code> arrives — and <code>done</code> must eventually arrive.</li>
  <li><strong>p_done_clean</strong>: from the moment <code>valid</code> is high, <code>data_ok</code> must hold on every cycle including the cycle that <code>done</code> fires.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>The <code>nexttime</code> operator is the single-step companion: <code>nexttime p</code> requires <code>p</code> to hold at the very next clock tick. <code>s_nexttime p</code> is the strong variant (fails if there is no next tick). These combine naturally with <code>until</code> to build recursive temporal patterns.</p></blockquote>
