<p>An implication property <code>antecedent |-> consequent</code> <strong><dfn data-card="Vacuous pass: an implication property trivially passes when its antecedent never triggers. The logic is 'if false, then anything' — mathematically valid, but useless for verification. A test suite where every assertion passes vacuously tells you nothing about correctness. This is why cover property is essential: it confirms the antecedent actually fired at least once.">passes vacuously</dfn></strong> when the antecedent never evaluates to true. The assertion fires zero times and reports no failures — which can be falsely reassuring.</p>
<p>The fix is to always pair an <code>assert</code> with a companion <code>cover property</code> on the same property. <code>cover</code> does <em>not</em> pass vacuously: its pass action only fires when the antecedent actually matched and the full sequence succeeded:</p>
<pre>rg_assert: assert property (req_gnt)
  else $display("FAIL at t=%0t", $time);
rg_cover:  cover  property (req_gnt)
           $display("antecedent fired at t=%0t", $time);</pre>
<p>This lesson has two steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open <code>vacuous.sv</code> and add the <code>assert</code> and <code>cover</code> statements. Run — notice the cover never fires, because <code>tb.sv</code> never drives <code>req</code> high.</li>
  <li>Open <code>tb.sv</code> and uncomment the TODO lines to pulse <code>req</code> and then drive <code>gnt</code> high. Run again — the cover fires, confirming the property was actually exercised.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote><p>If the simulation ends with zero <code>cover</code> hits and zero <code>assert</code> failures, the property has told you nothing. A clean run only means something when the cover confirms the antecedent fired.</p></blockquote>
