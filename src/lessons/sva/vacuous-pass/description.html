<p>An implication property <code>antecedent |-> consequent</code> <strong>passes vacuously</strong> when the antecedent never evaluates to true. The assertion fires zero times and reports no failures — which can be falsely reassuring.</p>
<p>The testbench below never drives <code>req</code> high, so <code>$rose(req)</code> never fires. The <code>assert</code> reports a clean pass, but nothing was actually checked.</p>
<p>The fix is to always pair an <code>assert</code> with a companion <code>cover property</code> on the same property. <code>cover</code> does <em>not</em> pass vacuously: its pass action only fires when the antecedent actually matched and the full sequence succeeded:</p>
<pre>rg_assert: assert property (req_gnt)
  else $display("FAIL at t=%0t", $time);
rg_cover:  cover  property (req_gnt)
           $display("antecedent fired at t=%0t", $time);</pre>
<p>If the simulation ends with zero <code>cover</code> hits and zero <code>assert</code> failures, the property has told you nothing.</p>
<p>Open <code>vacuous.sv</code> and add both statements. Run the simulation — notice the cover never fires. Then look at <code>tb.sv</code> and consider what change would make it fire.</p>
<blockquote><p>A common practice: suppress the <code>assert</code> pass action entirely (leave it empty) and rely on the companion <code>cover</code> to confirm the property was exercised. The assert only needs to fire when something goes wrong.</p></blockquote>
