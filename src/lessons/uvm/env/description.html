              <p>The <strong>environment</strong> (<code>uvm_env</code>) is the container that assembles agents and scoreboards. Its two key phases:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><code>build_phase</code> — creates child components top-down with <code>type_id::create("name", this)</code></li>
                <li><code>connect_phase</code> — wires <dfn data-card="TLM (Transaction-Level Modeling) ports are UVM's mechanism for passing data objects between components without tight coupling. A uvm_analysis_port on the monitor connects to a uvm_analysis_imp on the scoreboard; when the monitor calls write(item), the scoreboard's write() method is called automatically. TLM decouples producers from consumers — you can add a second subscriber without changing the monitor.">TLM</dfn> ports between components bottom-up</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Open <code>mem_env.sv</code> and complete both phases. All other components are already provided — this is the final connection that makes the full testbench run end-to-end:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>In <code>build_phase</code>: create the agent and scoreboard using <code>type_id::create("name", this)</code></li>
                <li>In <code>connect_phase</code>: wire the monitor's analysis port to the scoreboard's analysis export</li>
              </ul>
              <blockquote><p>The <code>this</code> argument in <code>create("name", this)</code> sets the UVM hierarchy parent. This determines the component's path in the tree, which scopes config_db lookups and reporting output.</p></blockquote>
