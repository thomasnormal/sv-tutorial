              <p>The <dfn data-card="The UVM factory is a registry that maps type names to class constructors. All UVM components and objects are created through it using type_id::create() rather than new(). This indirection enables factory overrides: you can redirect every create() call for a base type to return a subclass instead, without modifying the code that does the creating. It's the UVM implementation of the Factory design pattern.">UVM factory</dfn> lets you <strong>substitute one class for another</strong> at runtime without touching the code that creates objects. A single call in <code>build_phase</code> redirects every <code>type_id::create()</code> for the base type to a subclass instead:</p>
              <pre>BaseType::type_id::set_type_override(OverrideType::get_type());</pre>
              <p>After this call, any code that does <code>BaseType::type_id::create("item")</code> silently gets an <code>OverrideType</code> instead — including code you didn't write and can't modify.</p>
              <h2>Why it matters</h2>
              <p>Sequences and agents create items through the factory. Because they go through it, you can swap in a specialised subclass — corner-case item, error-injection item, or protocol-variant item — without touching the sequence or agent source.</p>
              <h2>Verifying the override</h2>
              <p><code>mem_item.convert2string()</code> calls <code>get_type_name()</code>, which returns the <em>actual</em> runtime class name. Without the override you'll see <code>[mem_item]</code> with interior addresses. After adding the override you'll see <code>[corner_mem_item]</code> with only boundary addresses (0 or 15).</p>
              <p>Open <code>mem_test_corner.sv</code> and add the factory override call inside <code>build_phase</code>: replace <code>mem_item</code> with <code>corner_mem_item</code> for all factory-created instances.</p>
              <blockquote><p>Both the base type and the override type must be registered with the factory via <code>`uvm_object_utils</code>. Check <code>corner_mem_item.sv</code> — it already has the registration macro.</p></blockquote>
