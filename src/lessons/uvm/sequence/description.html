<p>A <strong>sequence</strong> generates a stream of transactions. Its <code>body()</code> task runs when the sequence is started on a sequencer. The three-step handshake with the driver is:</p>
<ol>
  <li><code>start_item(item)</code> — request access; blocks until the sequencer grants it</li>
  <li>Randomize or configure the item while holding the grant</li>
  <li><code>finish_item(item)</code> — hand the item to the driver; blocks until the driver calls <code>item_done()</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Open <code>adder_seq.sv</code> and complete the <code>body()</code> task. The driver and agent are already provided — focus on the sequence side of the handshake.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sequences are objects (<code>uvm_object</code>), not components — they have no phases. Start them explicitly from a test's <code>run_phase</code> with <code>seq.start(sequencer_handle)</code>.</p></blockquote>
